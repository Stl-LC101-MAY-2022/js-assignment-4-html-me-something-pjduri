            <h3>So how did I get into this?</h3>
               <p id="origins1">I saw my first performance at a festival in 2003 and was immediately 
                  entranced.  Actually learning to spin fire, however, remained on my to-do list 
                  for the better part of a decade. 
               </p>
               <p id="origins2">
                  It was totally by chance that I became Facebook friends with someone 
                  who was part of a troupe of fire performers, and one day he made a post 
                  that they were looking for some new members as well as to train a few more 
                  safety spotters.  As an added bonus, I got to learn my first fire eating trick - 
                  extinguishing a torch in my mouth.  
               </p>
               <p id="origins3">
                  From there, I learned most everything else from a combination of YouTube and random 
                  encounters with peole who were willing to teach.  Check out the rest of the page to 
                  find out more!

            <h3>Safety Third <br>(But Still on the List)</h3>
               <p id="safety1">Let's face it.  Sometimes it's fun to do something dangerous.  
                  &quot;Safety First&quot; would be to &ast;not&ast; put burning torches in my mouth.  
               <br><br>
                  But what's the fun in that?
               </p>
               <p id="safety2">
                  So while we can enjoy dangerous things, we still don't want to be &ast;completely&ast; reckless, 
                  and dealing with fire is certainly no exception.  Here are some of the things we do in order 
                  to be slightly less unsafe:
               <br><br>
               <ul>
                  <li>Mind what you're wearing:
                     <br>Polyester + fire = bad for the skin.
                     <br>Grease paint makeup is how beards ignite (speaking from personal experience.)
                     <br>Light, loose-fitting and flowy articles of clothing ignight more easily.
                  </li>
                  <li>Bring a friend:
                     <br>&quot;Stop, drop and roll&quot; is all well and good, but I'd rather have 
                     someone with a towel who knows how to put out a fire on a person.
                  </li>
                  <li>Check your gear:
                     You don't want to send fireballs careening off into a crowd.  Some of them might be wearing 
                     polyester.
                  </li>
                  <li>FlameX for Natural Fibers:
                     Yes, there's literally a product called FlameX.  I use it to treat my safety towels.  
                     I have heard of performers using the synthetic fibers version to get away with wearing 
                     costumes they otherwise wouldn't, but I don't think I'd want to wear that stuff.  It smells.
                  </li>
                  <li>Learn from people who know:
                     Seriously.  Learning from YouTube is enough to pick up the movement, but have 
                     at least an experienced safety spotter present before attempting anything new with fire.  
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">This list isn't exhaustive, and not every performer agrees on every particular safety 
                  measure, but the point is to not just light things on fire and go.  
               <br><br>
                  Then again, <b>somebody</b> did exactly that at some point.  Otherwise these arts would not exist.

            <h3>Putting Burning Torches in my Mouth for Fun and (sometimes) Profit</h3>
               <p id="fireEating1">Having learned how to use my mouth to extinguish a burning torch, 
                  the next thing I learned was vapor control.  It's exactly as it sounds - I hold 
                  some fuel vapor in my mouth and slowly blow it out to make it look as though I'm 
                  slowly exhaling fire.    
               </p>
               <p id="fireEating2">It isn't as flashy as the 
                  massive plumes of fire that breathers produce, but it's up close and personal with 
                  fire and I like it.

            <h3>Getting Spinny With It!</h3>
               <p>A member of that first troupe made practice poi out of fabric and beanbags.  
                     Given how much more forgiving these were than the tennis balls, I started practicing 
                     again.  Having learned some names, websites and YouTube channels where I could learn, 
                     I dove in, and I dove in hard.    
               </p>
               <p>I loved it.  I could just trance out and go, with or without fire.  I practiced at bus stops.  I practiced in the yard before 
                  and after work (much to the amusement of the roomies and neighbors).  I practiced in the 
                  pool room at the hotel where I worked overnights.  I could not get enough.</p>

               <p id="closingThoughts1">It's not likely that I'll go back to doing this professionally.  
                  Ultimately, the business side of show business doesn't suit me 
                  and I'm already moving forward with other endeavors.

               <p>My hiatus from the art itself, however, ended with the creation of this page.  Lighting 
                  up for the first time in years felt amazing, and I'm already looking forward to next time.
