   <h3>So how did I get into this?</h3>
   <p id="origins1">I saw my first performance at a festival in 2003 and was immediately 
      entranced.  Actually learning to spin fire, however, remained on my to-do list 
      for the better part of a decade. 
   </p>
   <p id="origins2">
      It was totally by chance that I became Facebook friends with someone 
      who was part of a troupe of fire performers, and one day he made a post 
      that they were looking for some new members as well as to train a few more 
      safety spotters.  As an added bonus, I got to learn my first fire eating trick - 
      extinguishing a torch in my mouth.  
   </p>
   <p id="origins3">
      From there, I learned most everything else from a combination of YouTube and random 
      encounters with peole who were willing to teach.  Check out the rest of the page to 
      find out more!

   <h3>Safety Third (But Still on the List)</h3>
   <p id="safety1">Let's face it.  Sometimes it's fun to do something dangerous.  
      "Safety First" would be to *not* put burning torches in my mouth.  
      <br><br>
      But what's the fun in that?
   </p>
   <p id="safety2">
      So while we can enjoy dangerous things, we still don't want to be &ast;completely&ast; reckless, 
      and dealing with fire is certainly no exception.  Here are some of the things we do in order 
      to be slightly less unsafe:
      <br><br>
   <ul>
      <li>Mind what you're wearing:
         <br>Polyester + fire = bad for the skin.
         <br>Grease paint makeup is how beards ignite (speaking from personal experience.)
         <br>Light, loose-fitting and flowy articles of clothing 
      </li>
      <li>Bring a friend:
         &quot;Stop, drop and roll&quot; is all well and good, but 
         I'd rather have someone with a towel
         who knows how to put out a fire on a person.
      </li>
      <li>FlameX for Natural Fibers:
         Yes, there's literally a product called FlameX.  I use it to treat my safety towels.  
         I have heard of performers using the synthetic fibers version to get away with wearing 
         costumes they otherwise wouldn't, but I don't think I'd want to wear that stuff.  It smells.
      </li>
      <li>Learn from people who know:
         Seriously.  Learning from YouTube is enough to pick up the movement, but have 
         at least an experienced safety spotter present before attempting anything new with fire.  
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p id="safety3">This list isn't exhaustive, and not every performer agrees on every particular safety 
      measure, but the point is to not just light things on fire and go.  
      <br><br>
      Then again, <b>somebody</b> did exactly that at some point, otherwise these arts would not exist.

   <h3>Putting Burning Torches in my Mouth for Fun and (sometimes) Profit</h3>
   <p id="fireEating1">Having learned how to use my mouth to extinguish a burning torch, the next thing I 
      learned was vapor control.  It's exactly as it sounds - I hold some fuel vapor in my mouth 
      and slowly blow it out to make it look like I'm exhaling fire.    
   </p>
   <img src="images/weddingFireEat.jpg">
   <p id="fireEating2">It isn't as flashy as the 
      massive plumes of fire that breathers produce, but it's up close and personal with 
      fire and I like it.

   <h3>Getting Spinny With It!</h3>
   <p>A member of that first troupe made practice poi out of fabric and beanbags.  
      Given how much more forgiving these were than the tennis balls, I started practicing 
      again.  Having learned some names, websites and YouTube channels where I could learn, 
      I dove in, and I dove in hard.  I practiced at bus stops.  I practiced in the yard before 
      and after work (much to the amusement of the roomies and neighbors).  I practiced in the 
      pool room at the hotel where I worked overnights.  
   </p>
   <img src="images/poiWindmill.jpg">
   <p>I loved it.  I could just trance out and go, with or without fire.</p>

   <h3>Must I pick a favorite?</h3>
   <p>People often ask me which I enjoy more.  The answer is &quot;yes.&quot;

   <article id="closingThoughts">
   <h3>Fire in the Future?</h3>
   <p>I've been on a hiatus from performing for some time now.  It was 
      just one of those things where life got in the way and I could no 
      longer devote time and resources to burning.  I've recently pulled my 
      gear out and started seeing what I remember.  It's not likely that I'll 
      go out trying to get gigs again, </p>
