         <p>When I first heard that term, I was at Burning Man.
            Going by "Safety First" would involve *not* putting burning torches 
            in my mouth or dancing around while spinning fireballs on chains.  
            <br>But what's  the fun in that?  
            <br>Sometimes, it's fun to do dangerous things.  And fire performing is 
            certainly not the only form of creative expression that carries with it a measure of 
            danger.  Consider the sorts of injuries a professional ballet dancer can sustain over 
            the course of a career.  The row of blisters I got on my lower lip that one time...
            <br>...
            <br>... those two times I lit my beard on fire are minor compared to broken bones.
            <br> <br>That having been said, "dangerous" is not the same as "reckless."  I work with 
            safety spotters (and, in fact, started out as a safety spotter myself).  Other considerations 
            include wearing natural fibers (polyester + fire = bad for the skin) and dealing with the excess
            fuel in my wicks before starting a routine.
