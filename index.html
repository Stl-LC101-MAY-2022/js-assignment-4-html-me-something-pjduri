            <h2 class="right-oriented-headers">So how did I get into this?</h3>
               <p id="origins1">I saw my first performance at a festival in 2003 and was immediately 
                  entranced.  Actually learning to spin fire, however, remained on my to-do list 
                  for the better part of a decade. 
               </p>
               <p id="origins2">
                  It was totally by chance that I became Facebook friends with someone 
                  who was part of a troupe of fire performers, and one day he made a post 
                  that they were looking for some new members as well as to train a few more 
                  safety spotters.  As an added bonus, I got to learn my first fire eating trick - 
                  extinguishing a torch in my mouth.  
               </p>
               <p id="origins3">
                  From there, I learned most everything else from a combination of YouTube and random 
                  encounters with peole who were willing to teach.  Check out the rest of the page to 
                  find out more!

            <h2>Safety Third (But Still on the List)</h3>
               <p id="safety1">Let's face it.  Sometimes it's fun to do something dangerous.  
                  &quot;Safety First&quot; would be to &ast;not&ast; put burning torches in my mouth.  
               <br><br>
                  But what's the fun in that?
               </p>
               <p id="safety2">
                  So while we can enjoy dangerous things, we still don't want to be &ast;completely&ast; reckless, 
                  and dealing with fire is certainly no exception.  Here are some of the things we do in order 
                  to be slightly less unsafe:
               <br><br>
               <ul>
                  <li>Mind what you're wearing:
                     <br>Polyester + fire = bad for the skin.
                     <br>Grease paint makeup is how beards ignite (speaking from personal experience.)
                     <br>Light, loose-fitting and flowy articles of clothing ignight more easily.
                  </li>
                  <li>Bring a friend:
                     &quot;Stop, drop and roll&quot; is all well and good, but I'd rather have 
                     someone with a towel who knows how to put out a fire on a person.
                  </li>
      
                  <li>FlameX for Natural Fibers:
                     Yes, there's literally a product called FlameX.  I use it to treat my safety towels.  
                     I have heard of performers using the synthetic fibers version to get away with wearing 
                     costumes they otherwise wouldn't, but I don't think I'd want to wear that stuff.  It smells.
                  </li>
                  <li>Learn from people who know:
                     Seriously.  Learning from YouTube is enough to pick up the movement, but have 
                     at least an experienced safety spotter present before attempting anything new with fire.  
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p id="safety3">This list isn't exhaustive, and not every performer agrees on every particular safety 
                  measure, but the point is to not just light things on fire and go.  
               <br><br>
                  Then again, <b>somebody</b> did exactly that at some point, otherwise these arts would not exist.

            <h2>Putting Burning Torches in my Mouth for Fun and (sometimes) Profit</h3>
               <p id="fireEating1">Having learned how to use my mouth to extinguish a burning torch, 
                  the next thing I learned was vapor control.  It's exactly as it sounds - I hold 
                  some fuel vapor in my mouth and slowly blow it out to make it look as though I'm 
                  slowly exhaling fire.    
               </p>
               <img src="images/weddingFireEat.jpg"
                     alt="Exhaling ">
               <p id="fireEating2">It isn't as flashy as the 
                  massive plumes of fire that breathers produce, but it's up close and personal with 
                  fire and I like it.

            <h2>Getting Spinny With It!</h3>
               <p>A member of that first troupe made practice poi out of fabric and beanbags.  
                     Given how much more forgiving these were than the tennis balls, I started practicing 
                     again.  Having learned some names, websites and YouTube channels where I could learn, 
                     I dove in, and I dove in hard.    
               </p>
               <img src="images/poiWindmill.jpg">
               <p>I loved it.  I could just trance out and go, with or without fire.  I practiced at bus stops.  I practiced in the yard before 
                  and after work (much to the amusement of the roomies and neighbors).  I practiced in the 
                  pool room at the hotel where I worked overnights.  I could not get enough.</p>

            <h2>Must I pick a favorite?</h3>
               <p>People often ask me which I enjoy more.  The answer is &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
         </article>

         <article id="closingThoughts">
            <h2>Fire in the Future?</h3>
               <p id="closingThoughts1">It's not likely that I'll go back to doing this professionally.  
                  Ultimately, the business side of show business doesn't suit me 
                  and I'm already moving forward with other endeavors.  
               </p>
               <p>My hiatus from the art itself, however, is approaching its end.  I've already started 
                  picking the guitar back up, and fire and flow are next in line.
